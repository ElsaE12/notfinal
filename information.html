  <h1 id="heading">Biography: Elsa Elkaim</h1>

  <p id="semi">My name is Elsa Elkaim, and I am 24 years old. Originally from Nice, I pursued finance studies in Milan for my bachelor's degree before completing my master's degree in Paris and Madrid. My academic career was enriched by an internship at an investment fund in the Middle East, where I gained valuable experience in the financial field. Passionate about animals and travel, I am currently on exchange in Buenos Aires for a semester, an opportunity that allows me to discover a new culture while continuing to develop my professional skills. Looking ahead, I am particularly interested in working in venture funds, with a strong focus on the health tech sector.</p>
