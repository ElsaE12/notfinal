<h2>Why I decided to spend my semester in Argentina</h2>

<h3>By Elsa Elkaim</h3>

<h5>Last updated on September 2, 2024.</h5>

<p>I am a French student who grew up in Nice, on the French riviera. Thanks to my studies I had the chance to live in several cities in Europe and even in the Middle East. Each destination has enriched my vision of the world, but Buenos Aires represents a big step forward for me. It is the furthest I decided to go. This is a vibrant city, rich in history and culture, and I am excited to be able to immerse myself in this dynamic environment. </p>

<p>There are many destinations I could have chosen. But why Buenos Aires : </p>

<div>
<ol>
<li>Language: I have the chance to speak French, English and Italian, however speaking <strong>Spanish would be a valuable asset</strong> for me. This could be an useful professional and personal skil for me.</li>
<li>Culture: The opportunity of doing an exchange in Buenos Aires is, first of all, the opportunity to <strong>immerse myself in a very diverse culture.</strong> Indeed, that is my first time in South America, therefore I am really keen to discover this new way of life.</li>
<li>Academic Opportunity: Studying at University Torcuato di Tella allows me to <strong>discover new subjects,</strong> in a world reknown place. I was allowed to take subject that I do not have in my home university as my class of web design for instance.</li>
<li>People: Going in exchange is meeting new people. They could be exchange students as well or from the university. Being that far from our families create links between students and this <strong>intercultural environment</strong> is strongly rewarding.</li>
<li>Travels: Finaly, being in a region lika South America allows to discover many places. Argentina is <strong>a country full of ressources and beauty,</strong> therefore during your holidays you can use your free time to explore the country.</li>
</ol>

<p>In conclusion, my stay in Buenos Aires represents much more than just an academic experience. It is an opportunity to broaden my linguistic, cultural and personal horizons. Learning Spanish, discovering a rich and diverse new culture, studying unique subjects at Torcuato di Tella University, and connecting with people from different backgrounds will all contribute to my personal and professional development. In addition, exploring Argentina and its natural treasures adds an unforgettable dimension to this adventure. Buenos Aires marks a significant adventure in my life journey. </p>
